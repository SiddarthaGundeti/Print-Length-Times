# Print-Length-Times

Approach:

Read the input string.

Find the length of the string.

Get the first character of the string.

Print the first character N times, where N is the length of the string.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Step 1: Read the input string

Read the input string using the input() function and store it in a variable called string.

Step 2: Find the length of the string

Find the length of the string using the len() function and store it in a variable called length.

Step 3: Get the first character of the string

Get the first character of the string by using indexing and store it in a variable called first_character.

Step 4: Print the first character N times

Create a counter variable called counter and set it to 0. Then, use a while loop to print the first character N times, where N is the length of the string.

Inside the loop, print the first_character and increment the counter by 1.
